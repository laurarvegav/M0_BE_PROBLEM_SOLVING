# represents the current time rounted to the closest hour in 24-hour 
# military time. (i.e. 11 = 11:00 AM, 16 = 4:00 PM). The function

# (between 0 and 9) and returns a string of those numbers in the form 
# of a phone number. For example, if you were given 
# [5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the method or function will 
# return 555-123-4567.
